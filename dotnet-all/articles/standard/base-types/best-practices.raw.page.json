In most cases, it performs pattern matching rapidly and efficiently. However, in some cases, the regular expression engine can appear to be very slow. In extreme cases, it can even appear to stop responding as it processes a relatively small input over the course of hours or even days. </p>\n<p>This topic outlines some of the best practices that developers can adopt to ensure that their regular expressions achieve optimal performance. It contains the following sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"#consider-the-input-source\" data-linktype=\"self-bookmark\">Consider the input source</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"#handle-object-instantiation-appropriately\" data-linktype=\"self-bookmark\">Handle object instantiation appropriately</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"#take-charge-of-backtracking\" data-linktype=\"self-bookmark\">Take charge of backtracking</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"#use-time-out-values\" data-linktype=\"self-bookmark\">Use time-out values</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"#capture-only-when-necessary\" data-linktype=\"self-bookmark\">Capture only when necessary</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"#related-topics\" data-linktype=\"self-bookmark\">Related topics</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"consider-the-input-source\">Consider the input source</h2>\n<p>In general, regular expressions can accept two types of input: constrained or unconstrained. Constrained input is text that originates from a known or reliable source and follows a predefined format. Unconstrained input is text that originates from an unreliable source, such as a web user, and may not follow a predefined or expected format.</p>\n<p>Regular expression patterns are typically written to match valid input. That is, developers examine the text that they want to match and then write a regular expression pattern that matches it. Developers then determine whether this pattern requires correction or further elaboration by testing it with multiple valid input items. When the pattern matches all presumed valid inputs, it is declared to be production-ready and can be included in a released application. This makes a regular expression pattern suitable for matching constrained input. However, it does not make it suitable for matching unconstrained input.</p>\n<p>To match unconstrained input, a regular expression must be able to efficiently handle three kinds of text:</p>\n<p>• Text that matches the regular expression pattern.</p>\n<p>• Text that does not match the regular expression pattern.</p>\n<p>• Text that nearly matches the regular expression pattern.</p>\n<p>The last text type is especially problematic for a regular expression that has been written to handle constrained input. If that regular expression also relies on extensive <a href=\"backtracking\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">backtracking</a>, the regular expression engine can spend an inordinate amount of time (in some cases, many hours or days) processing seemingly innocuous text. </p>\n<div class=\"WARNING\"><h5>Warning</h5><p>The following example uses a regular expression that is prone to excessive backtracking and that is likely to reject valid email addresses. You should not use it in an email validation routine. If you would like a regular expression that validates email addresses, see <a href=\"verify-format\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">How to: Verify that strings are in valid email format</a>. </p>\n</div>\n<p>For example, consider a very commonly used but extremely problematic regular expression for validating the alias of an email address. The regular expression <code>^[0-9A-Z]([-.\\w]*[0-9A-Z])*$</code> is written to process what is considered to be a valid email address, which consists of an alphanumeric character, followed by zero or more characters that can be alphanumeric, periods, or hyphens. The regular expression must end with an alphanumeric character. However, as the following example shows, although this regular expression handles valid input easily, its performance is very inefficient when it is processing nearly valid input.</p>\n<pre class=\"loading\"><code class=\"lang-csharp\">using System;\nusing System.Diagnostics;\nusing System.Text.RegularExpressions;\n\npublic class Example\n{\n   public static void Main()\n   {\n      Stopwatch sw;    \n      string[] addresses = { &quot;AAAAAAAAAAA@contoso.com&quot;, \n                             &quot;AAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaa!@contoso.com&quot; };\n      // The following regular expression should not actually be used to \n      // validate an email address.\n      string pattern = @&quot;^[0-9A-Z]([-.\\w]*[0-9A-Z])*$&quot;;\n      string input; \n\n      foreach (var address in addresses) {\n         string mailBox = address.Substring(0, address.IndexOf(&quot;@&quot;));       \n         int index = 0;\n         for (int ctr = mailBox.Length - 1; ctr &gt;= 0; ctr--) {\n            index++;\n\n            input = mailBox.Substring(ctr, index); \n            sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();\n            Match m = Regex.Match(input, pattern, RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);\n            sw.Stop();\n            if (m.Success)\n               Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0,2}.

On the other hand, when the nearly valid email address has more than five characters, processing time approximately doubles for each additional character in the string. This means that a nearly valid 28-character string would take over an hour to process, and a nearly valid 33-character string would take nearly a day to process. </p>\n<p>Because this regular expression was developed solely by considering the format of input to be matched, it fails to take account of input that does not match the pattern. This, in turn, can allow unconstrained input that nearly matches the regular expression pattern to significantly degrade performance.</p>\n<p>To solve this problem, you can do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>When developing a pattern, you should consider how backtracking might affect the performance of the regular expression engine, particularly if your regular expression is designed to process unconstrained input. For more information, see the <a href=\"#take-charge-of-backtracking\" data-linktype=\"self-bookmark\">Take charge of backtracking</a> section.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Thoroughly test your regular expression using invalid and near-valid input as well as valid input. To generate input for a particular regular expression randomly, you can use <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/rex/\" data-linktype=\"external\">Rex</a>, which is a regular expression exploration tool from Microsoft Research.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"handle-object-instantiation-appropriately\">Handle object instantiation appropriately</h2>\n<p>At the heart of .NET’s regular expression object model is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.text.regularexpressions.regex\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex</a> class, which represents the regular expression engine. Often, the single greatest factor that affects regular expression performance is the way in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.text.regularexpressions.regex\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Regex</a> engine is used. Defining a regular expression involves tightly coupling the regular expression engine with a regular expression pattern. That coupling process, whether it involves instantiating a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.text.regularexpressions.regex\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Regex</a> object by passing its constructor a regular expression pattern or calling a static method by passing it the regular expression pattern along with the string to be analyzed, is by necessity an expensive one.</p>\n<p>You can couple the regular expression engine with a particular regular expression pattern and then use the engine to match text in several ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>You can call a static pattern-matching method, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.text.regularexpressions.regex#System_Text_RegularExpressions_Regex_Match_System_String_System_String_\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Regex.Match(String, String)</a>.

This is the default method for binding the regular expression engine to a regular expression pattern. It results when a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.text.regularexpressions.regex\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Regex</a> object is instantiated without an options argument that includes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.text.regularexpressions.regexoptions#System_Text_RegularExpressions_RegexOptions_Compiled\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">RegexOptions.Compiled</a> flag.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You can instantiate a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.text.regularexpressions.regex\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Regex</a> object and call an instance pattern-matching method of a compiled regular expression.

Unlike regular expression patterns used by regular expression objects, either the operation codes or the compiled Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) from patterns used in instance method calls is cached internally by the regular expression engine. </p>\n<p>For example, you might call a method to validate user input. In this example, a method named <code>IsValidCurrency</code> checks whether the user has entered a currency symbol followed by at least one decimal digit. A very inefficient implementation of the <code>IsValidCurrency</code> method is shown in the following example.

When a regular expression object is instantiated, the regular expression engine converts the regular expression to a set of operation codes. When an instance method is called, the operation codes are converted to MSIL and executed by the JIT compiler. Similarly, when a static regular expression method is called and the regular expression cannot be found in the cache, the regular expression engine converts the regular expression to a set of operation codes and stores them in the cache. It then converts these operation codes to MSIL so that the JIT compiler can execute them. Interpreted regular expressions reduce startup time at the cost of slower execution time. Because of this, they are best used when the regular expression is used in a small number of method calls, or if the exact number of calls to regular expression methods is unknown but is expected to be small. As the number of method calls increases, the performance gain from reduced startup time is outstripped by the slower execution speed.</p>\n<p>Regular expression patterns that are bound to the regular expression engine through the specification of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.text.regularexpressions.regexoptions#System_Text_RegularExpressions_RegexOptions_Compiled\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">RegexOptions.Compiled</a> option are compiled. This means that, when a regular expression object is instantiated, or when a static regular expression method is called and the regular expression cannot be found in the cache, the regular expression engine converts the regular expression to an intermediary set of operation codes, which it then converts to MSIL. When a method is called, the JIT compiler executes the MSIL. In contrast to interpreted regular expressions, compiled regular expressions increase startup time but execute individual pattern-matching methods faster. As a result, the performance benefit that results from compiling the regular expression increases in proportion to the number of regular expression methods called.</p>\n<p>To summarize, we recommend that you use interpreted regular expressions when you call regular expression methods with a specific regular expression relatively infrequently. You should use compiled regular expressions when you call regular expression methods with a specific regular expression relatively frequently. The exact threshold at which the slower execution speeds of interpreted regular expressions outweigh gains from their reduced startup time, or the threshold at which the slower startup times of compiled regular expressions outweigh gains from their faster execution speeds, is difficult to determine. It depends on a variety of factors, including the complexity of the regular expression and the specific data that it processes. To determine whether interpreted or compiled regular expressions offer the best performance for your particular application scenario, you can use the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.diagnostics.stopwatch\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Stopwatch</a> class to compare their execution times.</p>\n<p>The following example compares the performance of compiled and interpreted regular expressions when reading the first ten sentences and when reading all the sentences in the text of Theodore Dreiser&#39;s The Financier. As the output from the example shows, when only ten calls are made to regular expression matching methods, an interpreted regular expression offers better performance than a compiled regular expression. However, a compiled regular expression offers better performance when a large number of calls (in this case, over 13,000) are made. </p>\n<pre class=\"loading\"><code class=\"lang-csharp\">using System;\nusing System.Diagnostics;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Text.RegularExpressions;\n\npublic class Example\n{\n   public static void Main()\n   {\n      string pattern = @&quot;\\b(\\w+((\\r?\\n)|,?\\s))*\\w+[.?:;!]&quot;;\n      Stopwatch sw;\n      Match match;\n      int ctr;\n\n      StreamReader inFile = new StreamReader(@&quot;.\\Dreiser_TheFinancier.txt&quot;);\n      string input = inFile.ReadToEnd();\n      inFile.Close();\n\n      // Read first ten sentences with interpreted regex.\n      Console.WriteLine(&quot;10 Sentences with Interpreted Regex:&quot;);\n      sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();\n      Regex int10 = new Regex(pattern, RegexOptions.Singleline);\n      match = int10.Match(input);\n      for (ctr = 0;

However, when indeterminate quantifiers such as <strong>*</strong>, <strong>+</strong>, and <strong>?</strong> are used in a regular expression pattern, the regular expression engine may give up a portion of successful partial matches and return to a previously saved state in order to search for a successful match for the entire pattern. This process is known as backtracking.</p>\n<div class=\"NOTE\"><h5>Note</h5><p>For more information on backtracking, see <a href=\"regex-behavior\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Details of regular expression behavior</a> and <a href=\"backtracking\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Backtracking in regular expressions</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Support for backtracking gives regular expressions power and flexibility. It also places the responsibility for controlling the operation of the regular expression engine in the hands of regular expression developers. Because developers are often not aware of this responsibility, their misuse of backtracking or reliance on excessive backtracking often plays the most significant role in degrading regular expression performance. In a worst-case scenario, execution time can double for each additional character in the input string. In fact, by using backtracking excessively, it is easy to create the programmatic equivalent of an endless loop if input nearly matches the regular expression pattern; the regular expression engine may take hours or even days to process a relatively short input string.</p>\n<p>Often, applications pay a performance penalty for using backtracking despite the fact that backtracking is not essential for a match. For example, the regular expression <code>\\b\\p{Lu}\\w*\\b</code> matches all words that begin with an uppercase character, as the following table shows.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Pattern</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\\b</code></td>\n<td>Begin the match at a word boundary.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\\p{Lu}</code></td>\n<td>Match an uppercase character.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\\w*</code></td>\n<td>Match zero or more word characters.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\\b</code></td>\n<td>End the match at a word boundary.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Because a word boundary is not the same as, or a subset of, a word character, there is no possibility that the regular expression engine will cross a word boundary when matching word characters. This means that for this regular expression, backtracking can never contribute to the overall success of any match -- it can only degrade performance, because the regular expression engine is forced to save its state for each successful preliminary match of a word character.</p>\n<p>If you determine that backtracking is not necessary, you can disable it by using the <strong>(?&gt;</strong><em>subexpression</em><strong>)</strong> language element. The following example parses an input string by using two regular expressions. The first, <code>\\b\\p{Lu}\\w*\\b</code>, relies on backtracking. The second, <code>\\b\\p{Lu}(?&gt;\\w*)\\b</code>, disables backtracking.

However, excessive backtracking can severely degrade performance and create the impression that an application has stopped responding. In particular, this happens when quantifiers are nested and the text that matches the outer subexpression is a subset of the text that matches the inner subexpression. </p>\n<div class=\"WARNING\"><h5>Warning</h5><p>In addition to avoiding excessive backtracking, you should use the timeout feature to ensure that excessive backtracking does not severely degrade regular expression performance. For more information, see the <a href=\"#use-time-out-values\" data-linktype=\"self-bookmark\">Use time-out values</a> section.</p>\n</div>\n<p>For example, the regular expression pattern <code>^[0-9A-Z]([-.\\w]*[0-9A-Z])*\\$$</code> is intended to match a part number that consists of at least one alphanumeric character. Any additional characters can consist of an alphanumeric character, a hyphen, an underscore, or a period, though the last character must be alphanumeric. A dollar sign terminates the part number. In some cases, this regular expression pattern can exhibit extremely poor performance because quantifiers are nested, and because the subexpression <code>[0-9A-Z]</code> is a subset of the subexpression <code>[-.\\w]*</code>.</p>\n<p>In these cases, you can optimize regular expression performance by removing the nested quantifiers and replacing the outer subexpression with a zero-width lookahead or lookbehind assertion. Lookahead and lookbehind assertions are anchors; they do not move the pointer in the input string, but instead look ahead or behind to check whether a specified condition is met.

In addition to carefully considering your use of backtracking and testing the regular expression against near-matching input, you should always set a time-out value to ensure that the impact of excessive backtracking, if it occurs, is minimized.</p>\n<p>The regular expression time-out interval defines the period of time that the regular expression engine will look for a single match before it times out. The default time-out interval is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.text.regularexpressions.regex#System_Text_RegularExpressions_Regex_InfiniteMatchTimeout\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Regex.InfiniteMatchTimeout</a>, which means that the regular expression will not time out. You can override this value and define a time-out interval as follows: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>By providing a time-out value when you instantiate a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.text.regularexpressions.regex\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Regex</a> object by calling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.text.regularexpressions.regex#System_Text_RegularExpressions_Regex__ctor_System_String_System_Text_RegularExpressions_RegexOptions_System_TimeSpan_\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Regex(String, RegexOptions, TimeSpan)</a> constructor.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>By calling a static pattern matching method, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.text.regularexpressions.regex#System_Text_RegularExpressions_Regex_Match_System_String_System_String_System_Text_RegularExpressions_RegexOptions_System_TimeSpan_\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Regex.Match(String, String, RegexOptions, TimeSpan)</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.text.regularexpressions.regex#System_Text_RegularExpressions_Regex_Replace_System_String_System_String_System_String_System_Text_RegularExpressions_RegexOptions_System_TimeSpan_\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Regex.Replace(String, String, String, RegexOptions, TimeSpan)</a>, that includes a <em>matchTimeout</em> parameter.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have defined a time-out interval and a match is not found at the end of that interval, the regular expression method throws a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.text.regularexpressions.regexmatchtimeoutexception\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">RegexMatchTimeoutException</a> exception. In your exception handler, you can choose to retry the match with a longer time-out interval, abandon the match attempt and assume that there is no match, or abandon the match attempt and log the exception information for future analysis.</p>\n<p>The following example defines a <code>GetWordData</code> method that instantiates a regular expression with a time-out interval of 350 milliseconds to calculate the number of words and average number of characters in a word in a text document. If the matching operation times out, the time-out interval is increased by 350 milliseconds and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.text.regularexpressions.regex\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Regex</a> object is re-instantiated. If the new time-out interval exceeds 1 second, the method re-throws the exception to the caller.</p>\n<pre class=\"loading\"><code class=\"lang-csharp\">using System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Text.RegularExpressions;\n\npublic class Example\n{\n   public static void Main()\n   {\n      RegexUtilities util = new RegexUtilities();\n      string title = &quot;Doyle - The Hound of the Baskervilles.txt&quot;;\n      try {\n         var info = util.GetWordData(title);\n         Console.WriteLine(&quot;Words:               {0:N0}&quot;, info.Item1);\n         Console.WriteLine(&quot;Average Word Length: {0:N2} characters&quot;, info.Item2);

This element prevents the capture of matched substrings in the group to which it applies. It does not disable substring captures in any nested groups.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Use the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.text.regularexpressions.regexoptions#System_Text_RegularExpressions_RegexOptions_ExplicitCapture\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">RegexOptions.ExplicitCapture</a> option. It disables all unnamed or implicit captures in the regular expression pattern. When you use this option, only substrings that match named groups defined with the <strong>(?&lt;</strong><em>name</em><strong>&gt;</strong><em>subexpression</em><strong>)</strong> language element can be captured. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.text.regularexpressions.regexoptions#System_Text_RegularExpressions_RegexOptions_ExplicitCapture\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">ExplicitCapture</a> flag can be passed to the options parameter of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.text.regularexpressions.regex\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Regex</a> class constructor or to the options parameter of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.text.regularexpressions.regex\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Regex</a> static matching method.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Use the <strong>n</strong> option in the <strong>(?imnsx)</strong> language element. This option disables all unnamed or implicit captures from the point in the regular expression pattern at which the element appears. Captures are disabled either until the end of the pattern or until the <strong>(-n)</strong> option enables unnamed or implicit captures. For more information, see <a href=\"miscellaneous\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Miscellaneous constructs in regular expressions</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Use the <strong>n</strong> option in the <strong>(?imnsx:</strong><em>subexpression</em><strong>)</strong> language element.
