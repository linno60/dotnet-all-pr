{"content":"<div><div class=\"content\">\n<p>C# (pronounced “See Sharp”) is a simple, modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers.</p>\n<p>C# is an object-oriented language, but C# further includes support for <strong><em>component-oriented</em></strong> programming. Contemporary software design increasingly relies on software components in the form of self-contained and self-describing packages of functionality. Key to such components is that they present a programming model with properties, methods, and events; they have attributes that provide declarative information about the component; and they incorporate their own documentation. C# provides language constructs to support directly these concepts, making C# a very natural language in which to create and use software components.</p>\n<p>Several C# features aid in the construction of robust and durable applications: <strong><em>Garbage collection</em></strong> automatically reclaims memory occupied by unreachable unused objects; <strong><em>exception handling</em></strong> provides a structured and extensible approach to error detection and recovery; and the <strong><em>type-safe</em></strong> design of the language makes it impossible to read from uninitialized variables, to index arrays beyond their bounds, or to perform unchecked type casts.</p>\n<p>C# has a <strong><em>unified type system</em></strong>. All C# types, including primitive types such as <code>int</code> and <code>double</code>, inherit from a single root <code>object</code> type. Thus, all types share a set of common operations, and values of any type can be stored, transported, and operated upon in a consistent manner. Furthermore, C# supports both user-defined reference types and value types, allowing dynamic allocation of objects as well as in-line storage of lightweight structures.</p>\n<p>To ensure that C# programs and libraries can evolve over time in a compatible manner, much emphasis has been placed on <strong><em>versioning</em></strong> in C#’s design. Many programming languages pay little attention to this issue, and, as a result, programs written in those languages break more often than necessary when newer versions of dependent libraries are introduced. Aspects of C#’s design that were directly influenced by versioning considerations include the separate <code>virtual</code> and <code>override</code> modifiers, the rules for method overload resolution, and support for explicit interface member declarations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hello-world\">Hello world</h2>\n<p>The “Hello, World” program is traditionally used to introduce a programming language. Here it is in C#:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-csharp\" name=\"Hello World\">using System;\nclass Hello\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello, World&quot;);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>C# source files typically have the file extension <code>.cs</code>. Assuming that the “Hello, World” program is stored in the file <code>hello.cs</code>, the program might be compiled using the command line:</p>\n<pre class=\"loading\"><code class=\"lang-console\">csc hello.cs\n</code></pre><p>which produces an executable assembly named hello.exe. The output produced by this application when it is run is:</p>\n<pre class=\"loading\"><code class=\"lang-console\">Hello, World\n</code></pre><div class=\"IMPORTANT\"><h5>Important</h5><p>The <code>csc</code> command compiles for the full framework, and may not be available on all platforms.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The “Hello, World” program starts with a <code>using</code> directive that references the <code>System</code> namespace. Namespaces provide a hierarchical means of organizing C# programs and libraries. Namespaces contain types and other namespaces—for example, the <code>System</code> namespace contains a number of types, such as the <code>Console</code> class referenced in the program, and a number of other namespaces, such as <code>IO</code> and <code>Collections</code>. A <code>using</code> directive that references a given namespace enables unqualified use of the types that are members of that namespace. Because of the <code>using</code> directive, the program can use <code>Console.WriteLine</code> as shorthand for <code>System.Console.WriteLine</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>Hello</code> class declared by the “Hello, World” program has a single member, the method named <code>Main</code>. The <code>Main</code> method is declared with the static modifier. While instance methods can reference a particular enclosing object instance using the keyword <code>this</code>, static methods operate without reference to a particular object. By convention, a static method named <code>Main</code> serves as the entry point of a program.</p>\n<p>The output of the program is produced by the <code>WriteLine</code> method of the <code>Console</code> class in the <code>System</code> namespace. This class is provided by the standard class libraries, which, by default, are automatically referenced by the compiler.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s a lot more to learn about C#.
