It allows you to define a child class that reuses (inherits), extends, or modifies the behavior of a parent class. The class whose members are inherited is called the <em>base class</em>. The class that inherits the members of the base class is called the <em>derived class</em>.</p>\n<p>C# and .NET support <em>single inheritance</em> only. That is, a class can only inherit from a single class. However, inheritance is transitive, which allows you to define an inheritance hierarchy for a set of types. In other words, type <code>D</code> can inherit from type <code>C</code>, which inherits from type <code>B</code>, which inherits from the base class type <code>A</code>. Because inheritance is transitive, the members of type <code>A</code> are available to type <code>D</code>.</p>\n<p>Not all members of a base class are inherited by derived classes. The following members are not inherited:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/static-constructors\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Static constructors</a>, which initialize the static data of a class.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Instance constructors</a>, which you call to create a new instance of the class. Each class must define its own constructors.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/destructors\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Destructors</a>, which are called by the runtime&#39;s garbage collector to destroy instances of a class.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While all other members of a base class are inherited by derived classes, whether they are visible or not depends on their accessibility. A member&#39;s accessibility affects its visibility for derived classes as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"../language-reference/keywords/private\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Private</a> members are visible only in derived classes that are nested in their base class. Otherwise, they are not visible in derived classes. In the following example, <code>A.B</code> is a nested class that derives from <code>A</code>, and <code>C</code> derives from <code>A</code>. The private <code>A.value</code> field is visible in A.B. However, if you remove the comments from the <code>C.GetValue</code> method and attempt to compile the example, it produces compiler error CS0122: &quot;&#39;A.value&#39; is inaccessible due to its protection level.&quot;</p>\n<pre><code name=\"Inheritance\">using System;\n\npublic class A \n{\n   private int value = 10;\n\n   public class B : A\n   {\n       public int GetValue()\n       {\n           return this.value;\n       }     \n   }\n}\n\npublic class C : A\n{\n//    public int GetValue()\n//    {\n//        return this.value;\n//    }\n}\n\npublic class Example\n{\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        var b = new A.B();\n        Console.WriteLine(b.GetValue());\n    }\n}\n// The example displays the following output:\n//       10\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"../language-reference/keywords/protected\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Protected</a> members are visible only in derived classes.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"../language-reference/keywords/protected\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Internal</a> members are visible only in derived classes that are located in the same assembly as the base class. They are not visible in derived classes located in a different assembly from the base class.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"../language-reference/keywords/protected\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Public</a> members are visible in derived classes and are part of the derived class&#39; public interface. Public inherited members can be called just as if they were defined in the derived class. In the following example, class <code>A</code> defines a method named <code>Method1</code>, and class <code>B</code> inherits from class <code>A</code>. The example then calls <code>Method1</code> as if it were an instance method on <code>B</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code name=\"Inheritance\">public class A\n{\n    public void Method1()\n    {\n        // Method implementation.\n    }\n}\n\npublic class B : A\n{ }\n\n\npublic class Example\n{\n    public static void Main()\n    {\n        B b = new B();\n        b.Method1();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>Derived classes can also <em>override</em> inherited members by providing an alternate implementation. In order to be able to override a member, the member in the base class must be marked with the <a href=\"../language-reference/keywords/virtual\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">virtual</a> keyword. By default, base class members are not marked as <code>virtual</code> and cannot be overridden. Attempting to override a non-virtual member, as the following example does, generates compiler error CS0506: &quot;<member> cannot override inherited member <member> because it is not marked virtual, abstract, or override.<p>\n<pre class=\"loading\"><code class=\"lang-cs\">   public class A\n   {\n      public void Method1()\n      {\n         // Do something.\n      }\n   }\n\n   public class B : A\n   {\n      public override void Method1()  // Generates CS0506.\n      {\n         // Do something else.\n      }\n   }\n</code></pre><p>In some cases, a derived class <em>must</em> override the base class implementation. Base class members marked with the <a href=\"../language-reference/keywords/abstract\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">abstract</a> keyword require that derived classes override them. Attempting to compile the following example generates compiler error CS0534, &quot;<class> does not implement inherited abstract member <member>&#39;, because class <code>B</code> provides no implementation for <code>A.Method1</code>.<p>\n<pre class=\"loading\"><code class=\"lang-cs\">   public abstract class A\n   {\n      public abstract void Method1();\n   }\n\n   public class B : A                  // Generates CS0534.\n   {\n      public void Method3()\n      {\n         // Do something.\n      }\n   }\n</code></pre><p>Inheritance applies only to classes and interfaces. Other type categories (structs, delegates, and enums) do not support inheritance. Because of this, attempting to compile code like the following produces compiler error CS0527: &quot;Type &#39;ValueType&#39; in interface list is not an interface.&quot; The error message indicates that, although you can define the interfaces that a struct implements, inheritance is not supported.</p>\n<pre class=\"loading\"><code class=\"lang-cs\">   using System;\n\n   public struct ValueStructure : ValueType       // Generates CS0527.\n   {\n   }\n</code></pre><h2 id=\"implicit-inheritance\">Implicit inheritance</h2>\n<p>Besides any types that they may inherit from through single inheritance, all types in the .NET type system implicitly inherit from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.object\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Object</a> or a type derived from it. This ensures that common functionality is available to any type.</p>\n<p>To see what implicit inheritance means, let&#39;s define a new class, <code>SimpleClass</code>, that is simply an empty class definition:</p>\n<pre><code name=\"Inheritance\">public class SimpleClass\n{}\n</code></pre><p>We can then use reflection (which lets us inspect a type&#39;s metadata to get information about that type) to get a list of the members that belong to the <code>SimpleClass</code> type. Although we haven&#39;t defined any members in our <code>SimpleClass</code> class, output from the example indicates that it actually has nine members. One of these is a parameterless (or default) constructor that is automatically supplied for the <code>SimpleClass</code> type by the C# compiler. The eight seven are members of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.object\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Object</a>, the type from which all classes and interfaces in the .NET type system ultimately implicitly inherit.</p>\n<pre><code name=\"Inheritance\">using System;\nusing System.Reflection;\n\npublic class Example\n{\n   public static void Main()\n   {\n      Type t = typeof(SimpleClass);\n      BindingFlags flags = BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.Static | BindingFlags.Public | \n                           BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.FlattenHierarchy;\n      MemberInfo[] members = t.GetMembers(flags);\n      Console.WriteLine($&quot;Type {t.Name} has {members.Length} members: &quot;);\n      foreach (var member in members) {\n         string access = &quot;&quot;;\n         string stat = &quot;&quot;; \n         var method = member as MethodBase;\n         if (method != null) {\n            if (method.IsPublic) \n               access = &quot; Public&quot;;\n            else if (method.IsPrivate)\n               access = &quot; Private&quot;;\n            else if (method.IsFamily)  \n               access = &quot; Protected&quot;;\n            else if (method.IsAssembly)\n               access = &quot; Internal&quot;;\n            else if (method.IsFamilyOrAssembly)\n               access = &quot; Protected Internal &quot;;\n            if (method.IsStatic)\n               stat = &quot; Static&quot;;\n         }\n         var output = $&quot;{member.Name} ({member.MemberType}): {access}{stat}, Declared by {member.DeclaringType}&quot;;\n         Console.WriteLine(output); \n\n      }\n   }\n}\n// The example displays the following output:\n//\tType SimpleClass has 9 members:\n//\tToString (Method):  Public, Declared by System.Object\n//\tEquals (Method):  Public, Declared by System.Object\n//\tEquals (Method):  Public Static, Declared by System.Object\n//\tReferenceEquals (Method):  Public Static, Declared by System.Object\n//\tGetHashCode (Method):  Public, Declared by System.Object\n//\tGetType (Method):  Public, Declared by System.Object\n//\tFinalize (Method):  Internal, Declared by System.Object\n//\tMemberwiseClone (Method):  Internal, Declared by System.Object\n//\t.ctor (Constructor):  Public, Declared by SimpleClass\n</code></pre><p>Implicit inheritance from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.object\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Object</a> class makes these methods available to the <code>SimpleClass</code> class:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The public <code>ToString</code> method, which converts a <code>SimpleClass</code> object to its string representation, the fully qualified type name. In this case, the <code>ToString</code> method returns the string &quot;SimpleClass&quot;.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Three methods that test for equality of two objects: the public instance <code>Equals(Object)</code> method, the public static <code>Equals(Object, Object)</code> method, and the public static <code>ReferenceEquals(Object, Object)</code> method. By default, these methods test for reference equality; that is, to be equal, two object variables must refer to the same object.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The public <code>GetHashCode</code> method, which computes a value that allows an instance of the type to be used in hashed collections.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The public <code>GetType</code> method, which returns a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.type\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Type</a> object that represents the <code>SimpleClass</code> type.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The protected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.object#System_Object_Finalize\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Finalize()</a> method, which is designed to release unmanaged resources before an object&#39;s memory is reclaimed by the garbage collector.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The protected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.object#System_Object_MemberwiseClone\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">MemberwiseClone()</a> method, which creates a shallow clone of the current object.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because of implicit inheritance, we can call any inherited member from a <code>SimpleClass</code> object just as if it was actually a member defined in the <code>SimpleClass</code> class. For instance, the following example calls the <code>SimpleClass.ToString</code> method, which <code>SimpleClass</code> inherits from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.object\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Object</a>.</p>\n<pre><code name=\"Inheritance\">using System;\n\npublic class SimpleClass\n{}\n\npublic class Example\n{\n    public static void Main()\n    {\n        SimpleClass sc = new SimpleClass();\n        Console.WriteLine(sc.ToString());\n    }\n}\n// The example displays the following output:\n//        SimpleClass\n</code></pre><p>The following table lists the categories of types that you can create in C# and the types from which they implicitly inherit.

For example, the <code>Publication</code> class represents a publication of any kind, and the <code>Book</code> and <code>Magazine</code> classes represent specific types of publications.</p>\n<p>   [!NOTE] A class or struct can implement one more interfaces. While interface implementation is often presented as a workaround for single inheritance or as a way of using inheritance with structs, it is intended to express a different relationship (a &quot;can do&quot; relationship) between an interface and its implementing type than inheritance. An interface defines a subset of functionality (such as the ability to test for equality, to compare or sort objects, or to support culture-sensitive parsing and formatting) that the interface makes available to its implementing types.</p>\n<p>Note that &quot;is a&quot; also expresses the relationship between a type and a specific instantiation of that type. In the following example, <code>Automobile</code> is a class that has three unique read-only properties: <code>Moke</code>, the manufacturer of the automobile; <code>Model</code>, the kind of automobile; and <code>Year</code>, its year of manufacture. Our <code>Automobile</code> class also has a constructor whose arguments are assigned to the property values, and it overrides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.object#System_Object_ToString\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">ToString()</a> method to produce a string that uniquely identifies the <code>Automobile</code> instance rather than the <code>Automobile</code> class.</p>\n<pre><code name=\"Inheritance\">using System;\n\npublic class Automobile\n{\n    public Automobile(string make, string model, int year)\n    {\n        if (make == null)\n           throw new ArgumentNullException(&quot;The make cannot be null.&quot;);\n        else if (String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(make))\n           throw new ArgumentException(&quot;make cannot be an empty string or have space characters only.&quot;);\n        Make = make;\n\n        if (model == null)\n           throw new ArgumentNullException(&quot;The model cannot be null.&quot;);\n        else if (String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(make))\n           throw new ArgumentException(&quot;model cannot be an empty string or have space characters only.&quot;);\n        Model = model;\n\n        if (year &lt; 1857 || year &gt; DateTime.Now.Year + 2)\n           throw new ArgumentException(&quot;The year is out of range.&quot;);\n        Year = year;\n    }\n\n    public string Make { get; }\n    \n    public string Model { get; }\n\n    public int Year { get; }\n\n    public override string ToString() =&gt; $&quot;{Year} {Make} {Model}&quot;;\n}\n</code></pre><p>In this case, we should not rely on inheritance to represent specific car makes and models. For example, we do not need to define a <code>Packard</code> type to represent automobiles manufactured by the Packard Motor Car Company. Instead, we can represent them by creating an <code>Automobile</code> object with the appropriate values passed to its class constructor, as the following example does.</p>\n<pre><code name=\"Inheritance\">using System;\n\npublic class Example\n{\n    public static void Main()\n    {\n        var packard = new Automobile(&quot;Packard&quot;, &quot;Custom Eight&quot;, 1948);\n        Console.WriteLine(packard);\n    }\n}\n// The example displays the following output:\n//        1948 Packard Custom Eight\n</code></pre><p>An is-a relationship based on inheritance is best applied to a base class and to derived classes that add additional members to the base class or that require additional functionality not present in the base class.</p>\n<h2 id=\"designing-the-base-class-and-derived-classes\">Designing the base class and derived classes</h2>\n<p>Let&#39;s look at the process of designing a base class and its derived classes. In this section, we&#39;ll define a base class, <code>Publication</code>, which represents a publication of any kind, such as a book, a magazine, a newspaper, a journal, an article, etc. We&#39;ll also define a <code>Book</code> class that derives from <code>Publication</code>. We could easily extend the example to define other derived classes, such as <code>Magazine</code>, <code>Journal</code>, <code>Newspaper</code>, and <code>Article</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-base-publication-class\">The base <code>Publication</code> class</h3>\n<p>In designing our <code>Publication</code> class, we need to make several design decisions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>What members to include in our base <code>Publication</code> class, and whether the <code>Publication</code> members provide method implementations, or whether <code>Publication</code> is an abstract base class that serves as a template for its derived classes.</p>\n<p> In this case, the <code>Publication</code> class will provide method implementations. The <a href=\"#abstract\" data-linktype=\"self-bookmark\">Designing abstract base classes amd their derived classes</a> section contains an example that uses an abstract base class to define the methods that derived classes must override. Derived classes are free to provide any implementation that is suitable for the derived type.</p>\n<p> The ability to reuse code (that is, multiple derived classes share the declaration and implementation of base class methods and do not need to override them) is an advantage of non-abstract base classes. Therefore, we should add members to <code>Publication</code> if their code is likely to be shared by some or most specialized <code>Publication</code> types. If we fail to do this efficiently, we&#39;ll end up having to provide largely identical member implementations in derived classes rather a single implementation in the base class. The need to maintain duplicated code in multiple locations is a potential source of bugs.</p>\n<p> Both to maximize code reuse and to create a logical and intuitive inheritance hierarchy, we want to be sure that we include in the <code>Publication</code> class only the data and functionality that is common to all or to most publications. Derived classes then implement members that are unique to the particular kinds of publication that they represent.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>How far to extend our class hierarchy. Do we want to develop a hierarchy of three or more classes, rather than simply a base class and one or more derived classes? For example, <code>Publication</code> could be a base class of <code>Periodical</code>, which in turn is a base class of <code>Magazine</code>, <code>Journal</code> and <code>Newspaper</code>.</p>\n<p> For our example, we&#39;ll use the simple hierarchy of a <code>Publication</code> class and a single derived classes, <code>Book</code>. We could easily extend the example to create a number of additional   classes that derive from <code>Publication</code>, such as <code>Magazine</code> and <code>Article</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Whether it makes sense to instantiate the base class. If it does not, we should apply the <a href=\"../language-reference/keywords/abstract\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">abstract</a> keyword to the class. If an attempt is made to instantiate a class marked with the <code>abstract</code> keyword by a direct call to its class constructor, the C# compiler generates error CS0144, &quot;Cannot create an instance of the abstract class or interface.&quot; If an attempt is made to instantiate the class by using reflection, the reflection method throws a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.memberaccessexception\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">MemberAccessException</a>. Otherwise, our <code>Publication</code> class can be instantiated by calling its class constructor.</p>\n<p> By default, a base class can be instantiated by calling its class constructor. Note that we do not have to explicitly define a class constructor. If one is not present in the base class&#39; source code, the C# compiler automatically provides a default (parameterless) constructor.</p>\n<p> For our example, we&#39;ll mark the <code>Publication</code> class as <a href=\"../language-reference/keywords/abstract\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">abstract</a> so that it cannot be instantiated.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Whether derived classes must inherit the base class implementation of a particular members, or whether they have the option to override the base class implementation. We have to use the <a href=\"../language-reference/keywords/virtual\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">virtual</a> keyword to allow derived classes to override a base class method. By default, methods defined in the base class are <em>not</em> overridable.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Whether a derived class represents the final class in the inheritance hierarchy and cannot itself be used as a base class for additional derived classes. By default, any class can serve as a base class.

In many cases, however, the base class is not expected to provide an implementation. Instead, the base class is an <em>abstract class</em>; it serves as a template that defines the members that each derived class must implement. Typically in the case of an abstract base class, the implementation of each derived type is unique to that type.</p>\n<p>For example, each closed two-dimensional geometric shape includes two properties: area, the inner extent of the shape; and perimeter, or the distance along the edges of the shape. The way in which these properties are calculated, however, depends completely on the specific shape. The formula for calculating the perimeter (or circumference) of a circle, for example, is very different from that of a triangle.</p>\n<p>The following example defines an abstract base class named <code>Shape</code> that defines two properties: <code>Area</code> and <code>Perimeter</code>. Note that, in addition to marking the class with the <a href=\"../language-reference/keywords/abstract\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">abstract</a> keyword, each instance member is also marked with the <a href=\"../language-reference/keywords/abstract\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">abstract</a> keyword. In this case, <code>Shape</code> also overrides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../../../api/system.object#System_Object_ToString\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">ToString()</a> method to return the name of the type, rather than its fully qualified name. And it defines two static members, <code>GetArea</code> and <code>GetPerimeter</code>, that allow callers to easily retrieve the area and perimeter of an instance of any derived class. When we pass an instance of a derived class to either of these methods, the runtime calls the method override of the derived class.</p>\n<pre><code name=\"Inheritance\">using System;\n\npublic abstract class Shape\n{\n   public abstract double Area { get; }\n   \n   public abstract double Perimeter { get; }\n \n   public override string ToString() =&gt; GetType().Name;\n\n   public static double GetArea(Shape shape) =&gt; shape.Area;\n\n   public static double GetPerimeter(Shape shape) =&gt; shape.Perimeter;\n}\n</code></pre><p>We can then derive some classes from <code>Shape</code> that represent specific shapes. The following example defines three classes, <code>Triangle</code>, <code>Rectangle</code>, and <code>Circle</code>. Each uses a formula unique for that particular shape to compute the area and perimeter. Some of the derived classes also define properties, such as <code>Rectangle.Diagonal</code> and <code>Circle.Diameter</code>, that are unique to the shape that they represent.</p>\n<pre><code name=\"Inheritance\">using System;\n\npublic class Square : Shape\n{\n   public Square(double length)\n   {\n      Side = length;\n   }\n\n   public double Side { get; }  \n\n   public override double Area =&gt; Math.Pow(Side, 2); \n\n   public override double Perimeter =&gt; Side * 4;\n\n   public double Diagonal =&gt; Math.Round(Math.Sqrt(2) * Side, 2); \n}\n\npublic class Rectangle : Shape\n{\n   public Rectangle(double length, double width)\n   {\n      Length = length;\n      Width = width;\n   }\n\n   public double Length { get; }\n\n   public double Width { get; }\n\n   public override double Area =&gt; Length * Width;\n\n   public override double Perimeter =&gt; 2 * Length + 2 * Width;  \n\n   public bool IsSquare() =&gt; Length == Width;\n\n   public double Diagonal =&gt; Math.Round(Math.Sqrt(Math.Pow(Length, 2) + Math.Pow(Width, 2)), 2); \n}\n\npublic class Circle : Shape\n{\n   public Circle(double radius)\n   {\n      Radius = radius;\n   } \n\n   public override double Area =&gt; Math.Round(Math.Pow(Math.PI * Radius, 2), 2); \n\n   public override double Perimeter =&gt; Math.Round(Math.PI * 2 * Radius, 2); \n\n   // Define a circumference, since it&#39;s the more familiar term.\n   public double Circumference =&gt; Perimeter; \n\n   public double Radius { get; }\n\n   public double Diameter =&gt; Radius * 2; \n}\n</code></pre><p>The following example uses objects derived from <code>Shape</code>. It instantiates an array of objects derived from <code>Shape</code> and calls the static methods of the <code>Shape</code> class, which wraps return <code>Shape</code> property values. Note that the runtime retrieves values from the overridden properties of the derived types. The example also casts each <code>Shape</code> object in the array to its derived type and, if the cast succeeds, retrieves properties of that particular subclass of <code>Shape</code>.
