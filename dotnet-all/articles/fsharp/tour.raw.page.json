They are a grouping of unnamed, but ordered values, that can be treated as values themselves.  Think of them as values which are aggregated from other values.  They have many uses, such as conveniently returning multiple values from a function, or grouping values for some ad-hoc convenience.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-fsharp\" name=\"Tuples\">module Tuples =\n\n    /// A simple tuple of integers.\n    let tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)\n\n    /// A function that swaps the order of two values in a tuple. \n    ///\n    /// F# Type Inference will automatically generalize the function to have a generic type,\n    /// meaning that it will work with any type.\n    let swapElems (a, b) = (b, a)\n\n    printfn &quot;The result of swapping (1, 2) is %A&quot; (swapElems (1,2))\n\n    /// A tuple consisting of an integer, a string,\n    /// and a double-precision floating point number.\n    let tuple2 = (1, &quot;fred&quot;, 3.1415)\n\n    printfn &quot;tuple1: %A\\ttuple2: %A&quot; tuple1 tuple2\n</code></pre><p>As of F# 4.1, you can also create <code>struct</code> tuples.

Often times, strings and other primitive types are used to represent something, and are thus given a particular meaning.  However, using only the primitive representation of the data can result in mistakenly assigning an incorrect value!  Representing each type of information as a distinct single-case union can enforce correctness in this scenario.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-fsharp\" name=\"Unions\">// Single-case DUs are often used for domain modeling.  This can buy you extra type safety\n// over primitive types such as strings and ints.\n//\n// Single-case DUs cannot be implicitly converted to or from the type they wrap.\n// For example, a function which takes in an Address cannot accept a string as that input,\n// or vice versa.\ntype Address = Address of string\ntype Name = Name of string\ntype SSN = SSN of int\n\n// You can easily instantiate a single-case DU as follows.\nlet address = Address &quot;111 Alf Way&quot;\nlet name = Name &quot;Alf&quot;\nlet ssn = SSN 1234567890\n\n/// When you need the value, you can unwrap the underlying value with a simple function.\nlet unwrapAddress (Address a) = a\nlet unwrapName (Name n) = n\nlet unwrapSSN (SSN s) = s\n\n// Printing single-case DUs is simple with unwrapping functions.\nprintfn &quot;Address: %s, Name: %s, and SSN: %d&quot; (address |&gt; unwrapAddress) (name |&gt; unwrapName) (ssn |&gt; unwrapSSN)\n</code></pre><p>As the above sample demonstrates, to get the underlying value in a single-case Discriminated Union, you must explicitly unwrap it.</p>\n<p>Additionally, DUs also support recursive definitions, allowing you to easily represent trees and inherently recursive data.  For example, here&#39;s how you can represent a Binary Search Tree with <code>exists</code> and <code>insert</code> functions.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-fsharp\" name=\"Unions\">/// Discriminated Unions also support recursive definitions.\n///\n/// This represents a Binary Search Tree, with one case being the Empty tree,\n/// and the other being a Node with a value and two subtrees.\ntype BST&lt;&#39;T&gt; =\n    | Empty\n    | Node of value:&#39;T * left: BST&lt;&#39;T&gt; * right: BST&lt;&#39;T&gt;\n\n/// Check if an item exists in the binary search tree.\n/// Searches recursively using Pattern Matching.  Returns true if it exists; otherwise, false.\nlet rec exists item bst =\n    match bst with\n    | Empty -&gt; false\n    | Node (x, left, right) -&gt;\n        if item = x then true\n        elif item &lt; x then (exists item left) // Check the left subtree.\n        else (exists item right) // Check the right subtree.\n\n/// Inserts an item in the Binary Search Tree.\n/// Finds the place to insert recursively using Pattern Matching, then inserts a new node.\n/// If the item is already present, it does not insert anything.\nlet rec insert item bst =\n    match bst with\n    | Empty -&gt; Node(item, Empty, Empty)\n    | Node(x, left, right) as node -&gt;\n        if item = x then node // No need to insert, it already exists; return the node.\n        elif item &lt; x then Node(x, insert item left, right) // Call into left subtree.\n        else Node(x, left, insert item right) // Call into right subtree.\n</code></pre><p>Because DUs allow you to represent the recursive structure of the tree in the data type, operating on this recursive structure is straightforward and guarantees correctness.  It is also supported in pattern matching, as shown below.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can represent DUs as <code>struct</code>s with the <code>[&lt;Struct&gt;]</code> attribute:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-fsharp\" name=\"Unions\">/// Discriminated Unions can also be represented as structs via the &#39;Struct&#39; attribute.\n/// This is helpful in situations where the performance of structs outweighs\n/// the flexibility of reference types.\n///\n/// However, there are two important things to know when doing this:\n///     1.

In the above samples, you probably noticed quite a bit of <code>match x with ...</code> syntax.  This construct allows the compiler, which can understand the &quot;shape&quot; of data types, to force you to account for all possible cases when using a data type through what is known as Exhaustive Pattern Matching.

Like most everything in life, the answer depends on your circumstances.</p>\n<p>Tuples are great for returning multiple values from a function, and using an ad-hoc aggregate of values as a value itself.</p>\n<p>Records are a &quot;step up&quot; from Tuples, having named labels and support for optional members.  They are great for a low-ceremony representation of data in-transit through your program.  Because they have structural equality, they can be used in Pattern Matching.</p>\n<p>Discriminated Unions have many reasons, but the core benefit is to be able to utilize them in conjunction with Pattern Matching to account for all possible &quot;shapes&quot; that a data can have.  </p>\n<p>Classes are great for a huge number of reasons, such as when you need to represent information and also tie that information to functionality.  As a rule of thumb, when you have functionality which is conceptually tied to some data, using Classes and the principles of Object-Oriented Programming is a big benefit.  Classes are also the preferred data type when interoperating with C# and Visual Basic, as these languages use classes for nearly everything.</p>\n<h2 id=\"next-steps\">Next Steps</h2>\n<p>Now that you&#39;ve seen some of the primary features of the language, you should be ready to write your first F# programs!
