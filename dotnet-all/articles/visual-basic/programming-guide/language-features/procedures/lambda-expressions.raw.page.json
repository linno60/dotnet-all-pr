The differences are as follows:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>A lambda expression does not have a name.  </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Lambda expressions cannot have modifiers, such as <code>Overloads</code> or <code>Overrides</code>.  </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Single-line lambda functions do not use an <code>As</code> clause to designate the return type. Instead, the type is inferred from the value that the body of the lambda expression evaluates to. For example, if the body of the lambda expression is <code>cust.City = &quot;London&quot;</code>, its return type is <code>Boolean</code>.  </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In multi-line lambda functions, you can either specify a return type by using an <code>As</code> clause, or omit the <code>As</code> clause so that the return type is inferred. When the <code>As</code> clause is omitted for a multi-line lambda function, the return type is inferred to be the dominant type from all the <code>Return</code> statements in the multi-line lambda function. The <em>dominant type</em> is a unique type that all other types can widen to. If this unique type cannot be determined, the dominant type is the unique type that all other types in the array can narrow to. If neither of these unique types can be determined, the dominant type is <code>Object</code>. In this case, if <code>Option Strict</code> is set to <code>On</code>, a compiler error occurs.  </p>\n<p> For example, if the expressions supplied to the <code>Return</code> statement contain values of type <code>Integer</code>, <code>Long</code>, and <code>Double</code>, the resulting array is of type <code>Double</code>. Both <code>Integer</code> and <code>Long</code> widen to <code>Double</code> and only <code>Double</code>. Therefore, <code>Double</code> is the dominant type. For more information, see <a href=\"../data-types/widening-and-narrowing-conversions\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Widening and Narrowing Conversions</a>.  </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The body of a single-line function must be an expression that returns a value, not a statement. There is no <code>Return</code> statement for single-line functions. The value returned by the single-line function is the value of the expression in the body of the function.  </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The body of a single-line subroutine must be single-line statement.  </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Single-line functions and subroutines do not include an <code>End Function</code> or <code>End Sub</code> statement.  </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You can specify the data type of a lambda expression parameter by using the <code>As</code> keyword, or the data type of the parameter can be inferred. Either all parameters must have specified data types or all must be inferred.  </p>\n</li>\n<li><p><code>Optional</code> and <code>Paramarray</code> parameters are not permitted.  </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Generic parameters are not permitted.  </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"async-lambdas\">Async Lambdas</h2>\n<p> You can easily create lambda expressions and statements that incorporate asynchronous processing by using the <a href=\"../../../language-reference/modifiers/async\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Async</a> and <a href=\"../../../language-reference/operators/await-operator\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Await Operator</a> keywords. For example, the following Windows Forms example contains an event handler that calls and awaits an async method, <code>ExampleMethodAsync</code>.  </p>\n<pre class=\"loading\"><code class=\"lang-vb\">Public Class Form1  \n\n    Async Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click  \n        &#39; ExampleMethodAsync returns a Task.  \n        Await ExampleMethodAsync()  \n        TextBox1.Text = vbCrLf &amp; &quot;Control returned to button1_Click.&quot;  \n    End Sub  \n\n    Async Function ExampleMethodAsync() As Task  \n        &#39; The following line simulates a task-returning asynchronous process.  \n        Await Task.Delay(1000)  \n    End Function  \n\nEnd Class  \n</code></pre><p> You can add the same event handler by using an async lambda in an <a href=\"../../../language-reference/statements/addhandler-statement\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">AddHandler Statement</a>. To add this handler, add an <code>Async</code> modifier before the lambda parameter list, as the following example shows.  </p>\n<pre class=\"loading\"><code class=\"lang-vb\">Public Class Form1  \n\n    Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load  \n        AddHandler Button1.Click,   \n            Async Sub(sender1, e1)  \n                &#39; ExampleMethodAsync returns a Task.  \n                Await ExampleMethodAsync()  \n                TextBox1.Text = vbCrLf &amp; &quot;Control returned to Button1_ Click.&quot;  \n            End Sub  \n    End Sub  \n\n    Async Function ExampleMethodAsync() As Task  \n        &#39; The following line simulates a task-returning asynchronous process.  \n        Await Task.Delay(1000)  \n    End Function  \n\nEnd Class  \n</code></pre><p> For more information about how to create and use async methods, see <a href=\"../../concepts/async/index\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Asynchronous Programming with Async and Await</a>.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"a-namecontexta-context\"><a name=\"context\"></a> Context</h2>\n<p> A lambda expression shares its context with the scope within which it is defined. It has the same access rights as any code written in the containing scope. This includes access to member variables, functions and subs, <code>Me</code>, and parameters and local variables in the containing scope.  </p>\n<p> Access to local variables and parameters in the containing scope can extend beyond the lifetime of that scope. As long as a delegate referring to a lambda expression is not available to garbage collection, access to the variables in the original environment is retained. In the following example, variable <code>target</code> is local to <code>makeTheGame</code>, the method in which the lambda expression <code>playTheGame</code> is defined.
